# docker-compose.yml
# PostgresSQL documentation: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres
# docker compose down: stops and deletes containers, networks, volumes, and images that are defined
# docker compose up -d: starts application and all services, -d to run the services in the background
# docker exec -it factor_db psql -U postgres -d factor_data
  # docker exec -it: means run an interactive terminal in running container
  # factor_db: name of running container
  # psql -U postgres -d factor_data: use psql command-line interface to log into factor_data with postgres user

services: # definitions of all computing resources
  # each service will map string represetation of service names to their definitions
